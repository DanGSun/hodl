# HODL
**HODL is a dezentralized platform for payments, computing, storaging and DApps.** 

It has smart contracts which can be written in Python 3. **HODL** will use Proofs-of-work and Proofs-of-stake together. It is also platform for decentralized internet.
**HODL** will have clients for Linux, Windows, OS X, Android and IOS. It will support NFC.

**Installation**

*On Linux:*

	git clone https:github.com/hodleum/hodl.git
	cd hodl
	sudo ./install.sh
	
*On Windows:*

Install Python, Docker and sqlite3.

Download and unpack source.

Run `python setup.py install`

**Features:**

***Smart contracts***

*Easy*

It's very easy to write and run smart contracts. They should be written on Python, which is one of the most popular and easiest programming languages. You can put libraries into smart contract.

*Functional*

Smart contracts can use graphical interface and internet.

***Computing***

You can purchase computing which will be 100% right. Prices will be low because some money that come to miners for computing are new money.

***Decentralized storage***

You can put your data to HODL (encrypted, of course) for low price. (It is low because some money that come to miners for storaging are new money, like in decentralized computing)

***Decentralized internet***

Smart contracts can have graphical interface written in HML (HODL Markup Language) and domain name, so it can be used as decentralized internet.
